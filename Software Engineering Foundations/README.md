# Software Engineering Foundations
This section of the bootcamp is further foundations, specifically in Ruby. In this section I brushed up on Object Oriented Programming (OOP), as well as Test Driven Development (TDD) with RSpec. Most of the time of this section was spent flushing out "projects" which were basically applied learnings of topics in SWE/Ruby.

### Projects
