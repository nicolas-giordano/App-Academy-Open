# App-Academy-Open

## What This Is
This repository hosts my learnings and progress through the online free version of the App Academy bootcamp called _App Academy Open_. I have broken down the sections into their own folders based on the online course format. This bootcamp/repo will showcase technologies learned such as:

- Ruby
- Rails
- SQL
- Vanilla JavaScript
- React / Redux
- MongoDB
- Express / NodeJS
- Docker
- GraphQL

Further detail of specific materials can be found in the README of the sub-directories for each of the topics. Projects for each section will be referenced and linked in the README of the section.
