# Intro to Programming

## Learning Outcomes
This section is what I would consider the true "introduction" portion of App Academy. In this section I flew through a lot of the videos and exercises since I have previous experience in other languages. However, I did make sure to practice some of my skills translated over to Ruby.

Things that I touched on in Ruby were:
- Arrays
- Enumerables
- Hashing
- Loops (While)
- Map functions and Select functions
- Methods 

Not too much time was required for me to spend here. As stated, majority of this section was strictly familiarizing myself with basic Ruby syntax.
