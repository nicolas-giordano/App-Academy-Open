# Ruby
Further experience coding in Ruby. Making sure to get comfortable with creating RSpec tests for my projects and following TDD for my projects even though it seemingly takes more time for the development.

# Projects
| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Ghost | First "bigger" project created with Ruby. This was the first thing from App Academy that did not come with its own RSpec to run. Learned a lot about creating my own tests. |
